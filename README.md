# Yelp Fusion API Test

This is a quick test of CORS and CORS-anywhere methods to access the Yelp Fusion (v3) API under React 16. CORS fails (thanks, Yelp), hence this requires use of CORS-anywhere.

See https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack for information on Heroku deployment. 

NOTE: Heroku won't work with dotenv, which I'm using here.
